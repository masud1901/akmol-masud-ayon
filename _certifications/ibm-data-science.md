## Why I Took This Certification

When I started learning machine learning during my coursework, I quickly realized I needed more depth in the fundamentals. While my academic curriculum provided a solid theoretical foundation, I felt the need for comprehensive, hands-on training in data science tools and methodologies.

That's when I discovered this mega 12-course series from IBM. The breadth and depth of the curriculum, from Python programming to SQL, data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning—was exactly what I was looking for to fill the gaps in my knowledge.

**Skills Acquired:**
- Python for data science
- SQL for data querying and manipulation
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization best practices
- Introduction to supervised learning algorithms
- Hands-on projects with real-world datasets

## Impact on My Work

The practical, project-based learning approach in this certification has been invaluable. I've applied these skills across multiple research projects and at Nimbus Research Bureau, where I lead data science initiatives. The ability to clean, analyze, and extract insights from messy real-world data—skills honed through this certification—has become central to my work.

**Key Takeaway:** This certification was transformative in building my data science foundations, enabling me to tackle complex research problems with confidence and rigor.
