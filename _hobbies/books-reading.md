I can't say I'm a bookworm, but there's something magical about getting lost in a good book. Here's what I've been diving into lately:

## Currently Reading

- **Anna Karenina** by Leo Tolstoy - I haven't finished it yet, but I'm loving the dynamics Tolstoy brings into each chapter. Every character here feels real—they have their own thoughts, beliefs, and personalities. Watching Tolstoy collide these different worldviews through philosophical questions is genuinely fascinating.
- **Children of Dune** by Frank Herbert - Continuing the epic Dune saga. Honestly, after Dune Messiah, I felt empty. So I still haven't properly started this one.

## Recently Finished

- **Dune** by Frank Herbert - This has everything I wanted. Picking it up was harder since there's so much happening, but the last 50 pages made everything worth it.
- **Dune Messiah** by Frank Herbert - This one's my favorite. I loved how this book ended—there was no other way to do it with less bloodshed.
- **Neuromancer** by William Gibson - Previously my favorite book! One of the reasons I got into studying AI. Wintermute is a menace.

While Neuromancer was my favorite for a long time, Dune Messiah has recently topped it. The way Herbert explores themes of power, religion, and destiny in Messiah is absolutely brilliant. It's rare to find a sequel that not only matches but surpasses the original.

I used to read a lot of Bangla books. Humayun Ahmed is my favorite writer there. But now I'm really into Russian literature and sci-fi.
