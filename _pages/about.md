## About Me

I'm a machine learning researcher and M.Sc. candidate at the [Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University](https://iitju.edu.bd/). My work sits at the intersection of **computational social science**, **social sensing**, and **robust machine learning**. I work on and help maintain systems like [VoteBD](https://votebd.nimbusrb.com/) and [Melange](https://melange.nimbusrb.com/) to study how information, incentives, and algorithms shape collective behavior in the real world.

## Research Focus

I worked with [Dr. M. Hasan, PhD](https://sph.vcu.edu/about/portfolio/details/hasanm10/) (VCU) on **federated learning** and **trustworthy AI**, focusing on extreme client heterogeneity and communication-efficient optimization. Previously, under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammad Abu Yousuf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r2wOKBEAAAAJ&hl=en) , I worked on biomedical AI problems, which shaped my interest in learning under data scarcity and building robust machine learning systems that generalize reliably beyond idealized settings.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking **PhD opportunities** where I can study the link between **network topology**, **algorithmic curation**, and **collective behavior** in the context of platforms, elections, and large-scale social systems.

## Core Research Interests

- Computational social science and information diffusion
- Social sensing, dashboards, and platform analytics
- Graph representation learning and geometric deep learning
- Federated and robust learning for heterogeneous, real-world data
- Human–AI alignment in recommender and ranking systems
