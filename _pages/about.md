## About Me

I'm a machine learning researcher and M.Sc. candidate at the [Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University](https://iitju.edu.bd/). My work sits at the intersection of **computational social science**, **social sensing**, and **robust machine learning**. I work on and help maintain systems like [VoteBD](https://votebd.nimbusrb.com/) and [Melange](https://melange.nimbusrb.com/) to study how information, incentives, and algorithms shape collective behavior in the real world.

## Research Focus

I previously worked with [Dr. M. Hasan, PhD](https://sph.vcu.edu/about/portfolio/details/hasanm10/) (VCU) on **federated learning** and **trustworthy AI**, focusing on extreme client heterogeneity and communication-efficient optimization. I explore **multi-armed bandit** and **reinforcement learning** formulations for client selection and scheduling—ideas I now adapt to social platforms, where each "client" can be a noisy, biased slice of a population or network.

My earlier work in biomedical AI with [Dr. Mohammad Abu Yousuf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r2wOKBEAAAAJ&hl=en) taught me to care about data scarcity, robustness, and real-world failure modes. That experience now informs how I think about safety and bias in social computing systems.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking **PhD opportunities in Information Science / iSchools** where I can study the link between **network topology**, **algorithmic curation**, and **collective behavior** in the context of platforms, elections, and large-scale social systems. I'm also open to **Computer Science PhD programs** that work on machine learning for networks, social data, and trustworthy AI.

## Core Research Interests

- Computational social science and information diffusion
- Social sensing, dashboards, and platform analytics
- Graph representation learning and geometric deep learning
- Federated and robust learning for heterogeneous, real-world data
- Human–AI alignment in recommender and ranking systems
