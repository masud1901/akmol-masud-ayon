I am Md. Akmol Masud, an AI/ML Researcher specializing in Computer Vision and Federated Learning, currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Information and Communication Technology at the Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on cutting-edge areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with particular emphasis on:

- **Data-Efficient Deep Learning**: Developing methods to train effective models with limited data
- **Federated Learning**: Exploring distributed learning paradigms with privacy preservation
- **Trustworthy AI**: Building reliable and interpretable AI systems
- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Investigating quantum-classical hybrid approaches
- **Medical AI**: Developing diagnostic systems for healthcare applications
- **Computer Vision**: Advancing visual recognition and understanding systems
- **Generative AI**: Investigating creative and generative artificial intelligence

## Current Work

I am currently working on several exciting projects that span quantum machine learning, federated learning, medical AI applications, and computer vision. My recent publications in prestigious venues like IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence and various arXiv preprints demonstrate my commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI research, particularly in areas where classical and quantum computing intersect.

## Education & Background

I completed my B.Sc. in Information and Communication Technology from Jahangirnagar University in 2024, achieving a CGPA of 3.29/4.0 (with a strong final semester performance of 3.6). Prior to my university studies, I attended Sylhet Cadet College, where I completed both my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) in Science, achieving perfect GPAs of 5.0/5.0 in both.

## Professional Experience

### Co-founder & Research Analyst - Nimbus Research Bureau (Oct 2024 – Present)
I co-founded Nimbus Research Bureau where I design robust analytics pipelines to convert raw data into actionable, executive-level recommendations. I lead end-to-end market research projects, from survey design to delivery of strategic insights.

### Media, Communications, & Membership Development Lead - IEEE JU Student Branch (Feb 2022 – Aug 2024)
During my leadership role at IEEE JU Student Branch, I organized high-impact workshops and seminars with industry experts to enhance members' technical skills. I directed outreach campaigns that increased visibility and grew membership by 40%.
