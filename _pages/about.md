## About Me

I'm a machine learning researcher and M.Sc. candidate at the [Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University](https://iitju.edu.bd/). My work sits at the intersection of **computational social science**, **social sensing**, and **robust machine learning**. I work on and help maintain systems like [VoteBD](https://votebd.nimbusrb.com/) and [Melange](https://melange.nimbusrb.com/) to study how information, incentives, and algorithms shape collective behavior in the real world.

## Research Focus

### Social Sensing & Information Dynamics

I design systems that turn messy, high-velocity social data into structured signals about public mood, narrative shifts, and coordinated campaigns. Through platforms like **Melange**, I experiment with **neuro-symbolic pipelines** that combine LLMs, temporal modeling, and graph structure to detect early warning signals across heterogeneous information streams.

On the electoral side, **VoteBD** is a nationwide, anonymous election forecasting platform that uses **privacy-preserving device fingerprinting** to approximate "one person, one vote" without collecting personal data. It serves as a ground-truth bridge between online diffusion patterns and offline political behavior.

### Distributed & Robust Learning for Social Systems

I previously worked with [Dr. M. Hasan, PhD](https://sph.vcu.edu/about/portfolio/details/hasanm10/) (VCU) on **federated learning** and **trustworthy AI**, focusing on extreme client heterogeneity and communication-efficient optimization. I explore **multi-armed bandit** and **reinforcement learning** formulations for client selection and scheduling—ideas I now adapt to social platforms, where each "client" can be a noisy, biased slice of a population or network.

My earlier work in biomedical AI with [Dr. Mohammad Abu Yousuf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r2wOKBEAAAAJ&hl=en) taught me to care about data scarcity, robustness, and real-world failure modes. That experience now informs how I think about safety and bias in social computing systems.

### Graph, Geometric & Quantum Deep Learning

Methodologically, I draw on **graph representation learning** and **geometric / quantum deep learning**. My publications include work on **Lorentz-equivariant quantum graph neural networks** and **hybrid classical–quantum models** for high-stakes decision-making. These tools help me reason about non-Euclidean structure in both physical systems and social interaction graphs.

## Engineering & Leadership

I co-founded **Nimbus Research Bureau (NRB)**, where I lead R&D on production-grade social sensing and analytics platforms:

- **VoteBD**: An anonymous, crowd-sourced election forecasting platform for Bangladesh that emphasizes **open methodology**, **radical transparency**, and **privacy by design**.
- **Melange**: An invite-only intelligence system that provides early-warning social signals for organizations by aggregating multi-platform data into interpretable indicators.

Building and operating these systems has strongly shaped my research philosophy: credible theories about information dynamics and human–AI alignment must be tested in the wild, not just on static benchmarks.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking **PhD opportunities in Information Science / iSchools** where I can study the link between **network topology**, **algorithmic curation**, and **collective behavior** in the context of platforms, elections, and large-scale social systems. I'm also open to **Computer Science PhD programs** that work on machine learning for networks, social data, and trustworthy AI.

## Core Research Interests

- Computational social science and information diffusion
- Social sensing, dashboards, and platform analytics
- Graph representation learning and geometric deep learning
- Federated and robust learning for heterogeneous, real-world data
- Human–AI alignment in recommender and ranking systems
