I'm a machine learning researcher pursuing my M.Sc. at the [Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University](https://iitju.edu.bd/), focused on **trustworthy AI** and **federated learning systems**. My work investigates privacy-preserving distributed learning, communication efficiency, and robustness in heterogeneous environments.

## Research Focus

Currently, I work with [Dr. M. Hasan, PhD](https://sph.vcu.edu/about/portfolio/details/hasanm10/) (VCU) on federated learning systems, exploring adaptive client scheduling for extreme heterogeneous clients. I'm interested in formulating extreme client heterogeneity as multi-armed bandit problems, applying reinforcement learning frameworks to optimize communication-efficient training.

My research has evolved from biomedical AI to building trustworthy distributed systems. I started working with [Dr. Mohammad Abu Yousuf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r2wOKBEAAAAJ&hl=en) on medical image analysis. Dealing with high-stakes healthcare data—with so much scarcity and heavy dependence on data augmentation got me thinking about how to build robust AI systems and new ways of handling non-iid datasets. Collaborating with [Md. Abrar Jahin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VKKO-zAAAAAJ) on different ML problems helped me realize what I really care about: privacy-preserving and robust learning. That's what led me to federated learning.

I also co-founded Nimbus Research Bureau (NRB), where I lead data science projects in areas like behavioral finance and sociology. We build end-to-end pipelines for survey analysis, stock market patterns, and messy real-world data. Running this company has definitely shaped how I approach research. I want to solve real problems around data privacy, heterogeneity, and deployment challenges, not just hit benchmarks on clean datasets.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking PhD opportunities where I can advance research at the intersection of machine learning, distributed systems, and trustworthy AI. I'm particularly drawn to programs that value interdisciplinary approaches and bridge theoretical innovation with real-world impact, whether that's in privacy-preserving systems, robust learning algorithms, or AI applications to complex data domains.

**Core Research Interests:**
- Trustworthy AI
- Federated learning
- Social computing and computational social science applications
- Machine learning for complex systems (financial, social, behavioral data)
- Communication-efficient distributed optimization
- Reinforcement learning
