This research proposes and empirically validates a Privacy-Robustness Bound (PRB), a theoretical framework for quantifying the trade-off between differential privacy and model robustness against poisoning attacks in federated learning.

**Technologies Used:** Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, Robustness, Python
